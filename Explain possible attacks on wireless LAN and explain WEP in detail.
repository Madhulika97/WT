Explain possible attacks on wireless LAN and explain WEP in detail?

Wireless attacks are of two sub categories:

a) N/w attacks and

b) Device Security Information Attacks

Network Attacks:

a) DoS Attacks: flooding communication server with connection request.

b) Traffic analysis: wireless cards to track traffic load

c) Eaves dropping: access data flow that is not encrypted

d) Session interception: man in middle modifies message

e) Spoofing: attacker pretends to be leg it user

f) Capturing and retransmission: msgs contain identity location and credentials.

g) Info leakage: attacker pretends to be an mss

h) Modification: database change or program

i) Fabrication

Device Attacks:

    Pull attacks
    Push attacks
    Forced deauthentication
    Multiprotocol communication
    Mobility and roaming
    Disconnection
    Delegation

WEP (wired equivalent privacy)

    It is based on symmetric secret key
    Keystream is created using secret key and initialization vector (IV)

Frame body and ICV are encrypted.

Receiver checks ICV value that it has computes against what has actually arrived.

If same genuine data else discarded.
